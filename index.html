<p id="default_p">This is the team Eternity Bureau, we created this site inorder
to make people understand more about “us”, humanity's history. This 
website will give you a better insight to what happened throughout 
the course of history to our Earth, what took place, and significant 
figures who shaped our entire society. It will include a wide variety 
of things which includes, the formation of Earth, what is Earth’s 
environment throughout the ages, what is different periods of life 
evolving in Earth, and what are some historical figures that get us 
to where we are today. We have a timeline on the next page to let you 
discover all our knowledge. I hope this will give you a better 
understanding of our history, and good luck!</p>
